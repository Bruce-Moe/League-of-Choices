  storyText: "Now that you have a substantial lead against Renekton, who struggles
    when behind, you are able to continue applying pressure top and get more solo
    kills. Even though your mid lane loses to a Fizz, you become too tanky for Fizz
    to kill and eventually end up carrying the game with some help from your egirl
    Yuumi support. As the enemy nexus explodes, you type \"BETTER TOP WINS\" in all
    chat to assert your dominance and alpha male status one last time, which are
    obviously the defining traits of a true League of Legends gamer. \r\n\r\nCongrats!
    You won.\r\n\r\n1. Play again"
