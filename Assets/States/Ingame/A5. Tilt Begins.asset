  storyText: 'You decide to not trust your silver Blitzcrank to land a hook even
    if his life was on the line, and go toplane. Of course, your team proceeds to
    invade anyway. You watch as all four of them facecheck the river bush, and then
    BOOM. The enemy Sion support gets a four man knockup on your teammates, and the
    enemy Yi jungle picks up a level 1 quadra kill. Of course, your teammates immediately
    start blaming and spam pinging you because you didn''t come with them.
