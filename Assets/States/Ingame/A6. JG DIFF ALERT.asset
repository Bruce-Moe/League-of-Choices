  storyText: "Even though you have ignite, you allow Renekton to shove you in early
    and get lane prio. Unfortunately, this leads to the enemy Master Yi jungle invading
    your jungler and getting a kill and then getting double scuttle. To top things
    off, your jungler starts flaming you in chat and spam pinging you.\r\n\r\nYou're
    pretty tilted but you continue to play, believing the game to still be winnable.
    \r\n\r\n1. Mute your jungler and play on"
