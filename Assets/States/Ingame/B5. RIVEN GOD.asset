  storyText: 'After getting an early lead on Riven, you begin to snowball and you
    get a few more solo kills on Renekton before laning ends. You are then able to
    use this lead to carry teamfights and lead your team to victory, imitating the
    likes of Adrian and Viper as you show off the power of Riven.
