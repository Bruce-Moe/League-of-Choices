  storyText: 'By deciding to play passive against Renekton and letting him take prio,
    you miss your window to all-in him early with your ignite advantage and potentially
    get a kill. Because Renekton has tp, he is able to not only outsustain you in
    lane, but also tp back if he gets low on hp. After hitting 6, your ignite becomes
    less impactful as Renekton''s ult and items make him nearly impossible to kill
    alone.
